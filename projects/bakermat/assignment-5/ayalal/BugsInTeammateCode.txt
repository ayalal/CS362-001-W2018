Report on the bugs I found in Lorenzo's code.

Bug 1:
    Inside the Appt class on line 113 within Appt.java I found that the check on the startMonth should be -1,
    instead of just having no subtraction on there. The code from Lorenzo iterates out of bounds when testing the
    boundary cases for the months.

Bug 2:
    The second bug I found was on line 284 again in the Appt class. On that line the printable hour is set to
    += 12 instead of -= 12 like it should be. I found this bug through testing the hours of a particular appt.

Bug 3:
    In the CalDay class in CalDay.java on line 77 the statement currently says that:
        if (((Appt)getAppts().get())).getStartHour() is checked against < instead of the correct >. This causes
    the start hour of a particular appointment not to be checked properly.

Bug 4:
    In the TimeTable class in TimeTable.java there is a conditional on line 39 that checks if the first day is
    before the last day: if(firstDay.before(lastDay)), this should really be implemented as a negated conditional
    like so: if(!firstDay.before(lastDay)). I found this bug by adding two different appointments and checking
    their dates. The wrong appointments would be allowed.
