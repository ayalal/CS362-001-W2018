Reported bugs in teammates code (all line numbers are from atom text editor). 

Bug #1:
	Located at line 92, startMinute is not set to minute value instead it is set to the hour value(this.startMinute= startHour)
resulting in the wrong resulting value. Therefore when printed out the appointments will be incorrect and minutes will be limited 
to the range of the hours. This will also affect how the appointments are sorted if they share the same starting hour and date, 
resulting in an incorrectly sorted appointment list. 

Bug #2:
	Located at line 164, the if statement where (title != null) sets the title to "". This is a logic error as the statement
should be (title == null) then set it to the empty string, not if the title actually has a string. The resulting symptom will be
that any appointments created with a title will have that title wiped and replaced with an empty string giving the incorrect 
appointment title. Also based on the logic of the method the title will always be empty, making it difficult for the user to 
identify why an appointment was scheduled. 

Bug #3:
	Located at line 211, in the getDescription method the value that is returned is the title of the appointment and not the
actual description. Obviously this is another logic error within the code and would make it difficult to get the desired description
if needed. Also when the application is ran this will result in an empty description because we are returning the title of the 
appointment which due to bug #2 will be empty, resulting in an empty description as well. This bug will make the application somewhat 
useless to a user since they can set appointments but with no description, making it difficult to find the reason for that 
particular appointment.
